{"name":"Tablerender","tagline":"A jquery plugin to render table or grid views as server side guys call it with sorting, pagination and theming.","body":"### Table Render Plugin.\r\n\r\nThe plugin automates the creation of tables with data. It provides options for paging , templating headers, templating fields, creating amalgamated columns and lots more.\r\n\r\n### Usage \r\n1. Include jquery.js, tablerender.js and tablerender.css references on your page \r\n<head>\r\n    <title></title>\r\n    <link href=\"tablerender.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\r\n    <script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js\"></script> \r\n    <script src=\"tablerender.js\"></script>\r\n</head>\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
